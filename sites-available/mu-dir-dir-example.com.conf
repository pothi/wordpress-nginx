### Use case
# example.com has a non-WordPress installation at its root
# example.com/blogs is a WordPress multisite sub-directory installation
# example.com/blogs/blog1 is a site in WP multisite
# example.com/blogs/blog2 is another site in WP multisite
# The site would be accessed primarily as example.com (instead of www.example.com)
# Please replace blogs with the actual name of the sub-directory inwhich WP is (would be) installed

# Process requests to example.com
